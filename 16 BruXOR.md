# BruXOR

**There is a technique called bruteforce. Message: q{vpln'bH_varHuebcrqxetrHOXEj No key! Just brute .. brute .. brute ... :D**

This task requires us to bruteforce XOR to decipher the cipher. Since I am not bewandered in XOR, I will make a quick google search for `XOR bruteforce`. [dCOde](https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher) has an XOR cipher bruteforce which we can try:

Here, I just entered the cipher and pressed decrypt. There will be a lot of different results on the left, so we will just have to look through them and see what makes sense:

And we can collect our flag.
