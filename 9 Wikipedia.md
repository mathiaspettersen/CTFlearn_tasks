# Wikipedia.md  

**Not much to go off here, but itâ€™s all you need: Wikipedia and 128.125.52.138.**

As the task states, we have to go on a trip to Wikipedia. The IP address is the only information we get, so pasting this into the search bar is the only main idea:

As we see, there are not many results from the search other that the contributions from a specific IP address. Since we do not have much to go from, let's try to click around and see if we find anything. We will start with `diff`, which shows comments or articles that have been made by the author.

Appropriately enough, there is a post about flags with a comment labeled "==Competitions==". This line also contains the flag we are looking for.
