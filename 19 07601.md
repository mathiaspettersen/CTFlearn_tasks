The task gives us a link where we can download a picture from America's Got Talent. Since this is an image we can run either `exiftool` or `binwalk` on it to see if there is anything hidden. We will start with `binwalk`:

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Documents/ctflearn]
└─# binwalk AGT.png                   
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
9584          0x2570          Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, name: Secret Stuff.../

434649        0x6A1D9         Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, name: __MACOSX/Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../._I Warned You.jpeg
435702        0x6A5F6         End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```

I had to redact some of the output, but as we see, there are a lot of files hidden in this `AGT.png` image. Let's extract it:

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Documents/ctflearn]
└─# binwalk -e AGT.png --run-as=root
```

After extraction we are left with a `_AGT.png.extracted` folder. The folder contains some images that are zipped and a secret stuff folder:

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Documents/ctflearn/_AGT.png.extracted]
└─# ls -la
total 856
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Feb  3 13:02  .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Feb  3 13:02  ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 283892 Feb  3 13:02  25118.zip
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 426140 Feb  3 13:02  2570.zip
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 141674 Feb  3 13:02  47CA2.zip
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Oct 25  2016  __MACOSX
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Feb  3 13:02 'Secret Stuff...'
```

We can try to navigate the folder first. The folder leads us to an image: `I Warned You.jpeg`. This image cannot be opened, so we have to try to find some info without looking at the picture. `Exiftool` did not yield any results, so we can try with strings and grepping `|` for our desired string:

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/…/ctflearn/_AGT.png.extracted/Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This...]
└─# strings I\ Warned\ You.jpeg | grep -i "ctf"
ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}1r
```

The `-i` flag in grep is for case insensitivity. And we have our flag.

Flag: `ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}`
