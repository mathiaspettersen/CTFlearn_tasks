# HyperStream Test #2

**I love the smell of bacon in the morning! ABAAAABABAABBABBAABBAABAAAAAABAAAAAAAABAABBABABBAAAAABBABBABABBAABAABABABBAABBABBAABB**

In this task we are given a weird set of seemingly randowmized As and Bs. As this is a type of challenge I am familiar with, I recognize this as being a `Baconian cipher` which works by making each combination of As and Bs in pairs of 5 mean a letter. 

For example, the cipher can be divided into: `ABAAA ABABA ABBAB BAABB AABAA AAAAB AAAAA AAABA ABBAB ABBAA AAABB ABBAB ABBAA BAABA BABBA ABBAB BAABB`, and paired with the Baconian cipher shett below:

Using this knowledge, we can decipher the cipher, meaning: `ABAAA (I) ABABA (L) ABBAB (O) BAABB (U) AABAA (E) AAAAB (B) AAAAA (A) AAABA (C) ABBAB (O) ABBAA (N) AAABB (D) ABBAB (O) ABBAA (N) BAABA (T) BABBA (Y) ABBAB (O) BAABB (U)`

And we can collect our flag.
