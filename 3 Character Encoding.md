# Character Encoding

**In the computing industry, standards are established to facilitate information interchanges among American coders. Unfortunately, I've made communication a little bit more difficult. Can you figure this one out? 41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D**

Typically, computers encode strings to make it easier for them to read and process. The task we are given revolves around decoding (not decrypting) the series of characters. Being familiar with the types of encoding and encryption comes naturally as one deals with them, but for learning's sake, let's find out what type of encoding this is.

`CyberChef`is an excellent en/decryption and en/decoding online tool. If we just paste our characters it suggests that it is a `hex` encoding:

If we press this button, it automatically adds `from hex` to the recipe, giving us the flag:
