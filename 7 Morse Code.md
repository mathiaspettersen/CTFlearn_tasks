This is a rather easy one compared to the other challengens. As the title says, and as it appears, this is morse code consisting of dots and dashes. If one has the time, one could manually translate bit by bit, but since we are lazy hackers, we will just use [`CyberChef`](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

Adding the `From Morse Code` option into the Recipe gives us an output which is our flag.
